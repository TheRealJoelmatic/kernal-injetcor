# ⚠️ DISCLAIMER - DEPRECATED CODEBASE ⚠️

> **This project is deprecated and provided solely for educational reference.**

This code is being publicly released **only** because certain individuals have attempted to **sell it without permission**, falsely claiming it as their own. I am publishing it here to prevent scammers from profiting off work they didn’t write and to shut down any misinformation surrounding its origin.

### ❗ Important Warnings:
- **This source code is flawed.**
- **It should NEVER be used in production or for any form of cheating.**
- **This project was written ~2 years ago** during the early stages of my development journey.
- **It does NOT reflect my current coding standards, knowledge, or practices.**
- **Only the usermode code is being leaked here. The kernel driver is NOT included and was only ever sold as a precompiled `.sys` file.**

## 🧠 Technical Notes

### 🔒 Detection Status:
- The driver implementation in this repo is **currently detectable (DTC)**. If you're smart and know what you're doing, you *could* make it undetected with proper modifications, but as-is, it will not bypass modern anti-cheats.

### 🪝 Hooking Info:
- The method used to hook `NtQueryCompositionSurfaceStatistics` is **100% detectable** in the way it is implemented here.

### 💉 Injection Method:
- The injection logic was inspired by this: [`face-injector-v2`](https://github.com/KANKOSHEV/face-injector-v2/blob/main/face_injector_v2/inject/injector.h).
- This method **can be valid** if used with a different driver (i.e., swapped out), but again, the way it's used here is not viable in current-day scenarios.

### 📦 kdmapper Version:
- This repo uses an **outdated kdmapper**, which means it doesn’t even function on newer versions of Windows (post-22H2).
- The loader is not properly maintained and would need a full rewrite to even be useful again.

### 🤖 AI-Generated Code:
- There is code in this repository that was **assisted/generated by ChatGPT**, especially for utility functions and boilerplate. This code was never fully tested or hardened.

## 🧵 Final Notes
This was one of my **early projects**, and while it served as a valuable learning experience, **it is not safe, undetected, or up to par with any modern standards**.
Anyone trying to repackage or resell this is simply scamming you.
Use it only to learn from the mistakes and outdated techniques.
